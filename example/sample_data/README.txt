We have some very simple data for our example.  Just three unrelated data files of 1000 records that allow illustration of DataSpider crawling as well as a simple set of Bot orchestrated tasks.  These files of fake test data were created at https://www.mockaroo.com.

1) cars.csv - Just a list of make,model,year of various cars.
2) companies.csv - Just a list of id,name,symbol,mkt_value,sector for companies
3) person.csv - Just a list of id,first_name,last_name,email,gender,ip_address
